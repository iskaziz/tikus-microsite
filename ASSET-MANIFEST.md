## Character portraits

Seven approved, opaque square portraits are included for the reverse sides of the Mimi, Jay, Saladin, Madam Boey, Major Mansor, Alayna and Guy cards.

| Character | Base filename | Formats | Responsive dimensions | True transparency |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Mimi | `mimi` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Jay | `jay` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Saladin | `saladin` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Madam Boey | `madam-boey` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Major Mansor | `mejar-mansor` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Alayna | `alayna` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |
| Guy | `guy` | AVIF, WebP, JPEG | `480 × 480`, `720 × 720` | No |

The remaining Inspektor Mislan character card retains its existing illustrated placeholder until approved artwork is supplied. Actor-side portraits also remain placeholders. Portraits are lazy-loaded and use AVIF first, WebP second and progressive JPEG as the fallback.

## Tikus Beat weapon icons

Five approved transparent illustrations are delivered under `assets/images/games/tikus-beat/`. Public filenames are lane-based to keep the deployed package spoiler-conscious.

| Lane | Formats | Responsive maximum dimensions | True transparency |
|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | WebP, PNG | `256 × 184`, `512 × 368` | Yes |
| 2 | WebP, PNG | `191 × 256`, `381 × 512` | Yes |
| 3 | WebP, PNG | `172 × 256`, `344 × 512` | Yes |
| 4 | WebP, PNG | `256 × 116`, `512 × 232` | Yes |
| 5 | WebP, PNG | `256 × 222`, `512 × 443` | Yes |

The icon artwork is loaded only when Tikus Beat is mounted. WebP is preferred through `<picture>`, with transparent PNG as the fallback.

## Delivery recommendations

- **Title:** WebP is preferred where supported; transparent PNG remains the fallback. Both title PNG files contain real alpha transparency.
- **Main scenes:** House and Sitting Room artwork use AVIF first, WebP second and progressive JPEG as the fallback. Both are opaque and use a 16:9 ratio.
- **Character portraits:** AVIF is preferred, WebP is secondary and progressive JPEG is the fallback.
- **Preloading:** Only the title and house exterior are preloaded. The Sitting Room is prefetched on pointer, focus or touch interaction with the house entry control.
- **Cropping:** Main stage images use `object-fit: contain` so essential composition is not cropped on mobile.

## Source transparency findings

- Approved title derivatives in `assets/images/title/` retain true transparency.
- House, Sitting Room and character portrait source illustrations are RGB/opaque and do not require transparency.
- No image is embedded as base64 data.
